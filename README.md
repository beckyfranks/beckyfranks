### Hi, I'm Rebecca (Becky for short) 👋

I am a learner experience designer specialising in Computing 💾. I have a real passion for inclusion and want to make Computing accessible to all! I enjoy creating with technology 🎨 and I like to do a bit of gaming 🎮 in my own time. I am a big Mario fan but have just started dabbling with Zelda, Breath of the Wild.
